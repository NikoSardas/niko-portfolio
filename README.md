# Niko Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio site, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and deployed via GitHub Pages.

It includes:

- Resume (internal tools, dev-adjacent, IT support)
- Featured project: [Equalizer Plus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/equalizer-plus/hhknncjekdkcckekbooephopomcjeiek) â€“ a Chrome extension with 10K+ users
- Background in Chrome APIs, Web Audio, scripting, and enterprise IT

## Tech Stack

- [Next.js 14+](https://nextjs.org/)
- App Router + Static Export (`output: export`)
- Tailwind CSS
- GitHub Pages for deployment

## Deployment

```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
This will publish the /out folder to the gh-pages branch.
